# 🏋️ Obesity Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📊 Project Overview
Obesity is a complex and multifaceted health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It is influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Early detection and prevention of obesity are crucial for reducing the risk of associated health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information on 17 key variables related to demographic characteristics, family history, and lifestyle habits. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that contribute to obesity and to develop a foundation for a predictive machine learning model.

## 📝 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following key variables:

### 🏡 *Demographic Characteristics*
- *Gender*: Male/Female
- *Age*: Age of the individual
- *Height*: Height of the individual (in meters)
- *Weight*: Weight of the individual (in kilograms)

### 👨‍🏻‍🎓 *Family History*
- *Family History of Obesity*: Whether the individual has a family history of obesity

### 🍔 *Lifestyle Habits*
#### 🌿 Dietary Patterns
- *FCVC*: Frequency of vegetable consumption
- *FAVC*: Frequency of alcohol consumption

#### 🏋️ Physical Activity Levels
- *SCC*: Sedentary behavior (e.g., hours spent sitting per day)
- *TUE*: Transportation usage for daily commute
- *MTRANS*: Main mode of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving)

#### 🚬 Smoking Habits
- *SMOKE*: Smoking habits of the individual

#### 💧 Hydration Levels
- *CH2O*: Consumption of water per day

#### 🧀 Calcium Intake
- *CALC*: Calcium intake per day

#### 🍽 Eating Habits
- *FAF*: Frequency of eating away from home
- *NCP*: Number of main meals consumed per day

## 🌟 Objectives
The primary objectives of this EDA project are:
- 🔹 Understanding the distribution and relationships among obesity-related factors
- 🔹 Identifying significant lifestyle and demographic predictors of obesity
- 🔹 Exploring correlations between family history and obesity trends
- 🔹 Analyzing dietary and activity habits that influence obesity risk

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- *Python* (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- *Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab* for interactive analysis
- *Data visualization* for pattern recognition and insights

## 💡 Project Workflow
1. *Data Cleaning*
   - Handling missing values
   - Standardizing data types
   - Data transformation where necessary
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - Statistical summaries and feature distribution analysis
   - Correlation analysis among variables
   - Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps)
3. *Insights and Recommendations*
   - Identifying key risk factors for obesity
   - Providing data-driven recommendations for obesity prevention

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive insights into obesity-related factors
- Identification of key predictors for obesity classification
- Data-driven recommendations to promote healthier lifestyles
- Foundation for building a predictive machine learning model
